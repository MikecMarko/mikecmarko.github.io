								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I was born in Zagreb, Croatia on November 28, 1994. At the moment I am living with my parents in our family
								home near Zaprešić, where I have also finished primary school and high school. I graduated high school in 2019. My thesis
								subject in high school was on Windows operating systems, for which I also got the vocational qualification for computer
								technician. I graduated from college in 2020 where I got the Bachelor of Business Informatics, with my final paper thesis
								about the analysis of structured data in Office. I also have the network specialist certificate (CCNA), which I acquired in
								2019 from Algebra. Furthermore, concerning driver’s licenses, I have the B category and the Forklift Operation
								Certification.</p><br>
								<p>In my free time I like to play online video games with friends and going to the gym. Every now and then I like to
								plan and organize a trip somewhere, does not matter where just that its somewhere I have not been before.
								During high school I did my internship in a local computer repair shop (Elting P. d.o.o.) where I learned many useful
								things about computers and it also helped me improve my organizational skills. All of this got me even more interested in
								informatics and ICT. After graduating high school, I worked as a warehouse worker in Fackelmann for a half year and as a
								waiter in a bar called ‘Joe’. After that I got a student’s job as a warehouse worker in Inter Cars, where I am currently still
								employed. However, I did get promoted to the purchase department as a specialist for the tire segment. In the five years
								that I have worked for Inter Cars I got promoted four times and changed four job positions, whilst also parallel studying
								for my bachelor’s degree.</p><br>
								<p>Furthermore, I am very resourceful with working on the computer and I have no problem learning about and how
								to use new software’s. I am skilled with Microsoft Office applications because I had to use them through high school and
								college, and every day at work. At work I use Microsoft Excel and Access for generating reports and for analysis. Another
								software that I use at work is Microsoft Dynamics NAV (all the functionalities regarding logistics, sales and purchase
								departments). I am also familiar with photo editing software’s like Adobe Photoshop and Gimp which I had to use for
								college projects. In my free time I also do minor cell phone repairs, for example the replacement of screens or other
								specific cell phone parts.</p><br>
								<p>Moreover, concerning programming languages I am skilled with PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MySQL. I used these programming
								languages for various projects during college, for example when I had to build a website as an assignment. I am familiar
								with Python, C++ and Visual Basic and know the basics for these programming languages, because I was introduced to
								some of them in high school and college. Whenever I had free time, I took free online courses to deepen my knowledge
								about these programming languages. I as well know Cisco IOS and CLI which are used for configuring, monitoring and
								maintaining Cisco devices. I learned about Cisco IOS and CLI at the Algebra academy.</p><br>
								<p>Concerning languages, I would like to point out that I have learned English for more than 10 years, making it easy
								for me to understand English and use it in conversations. I am also familiar with German (basic), because I learned it in
								primary school but I have no experience in conversating in German. I do plan to renew my German language knowledge
								eventually as well as to learn the Dutch language and Spanish language.</p><br>
								<p>Finally, I am a very persistent person who does not give up easily when I set my mind on to something. I am very
								ambitious, and I love to learn new things, especially regarding ICT and informatics. I have no problems with working in a
								team or working by myself. I am interested in any kind of education, whether it would be job related or no.</p>
